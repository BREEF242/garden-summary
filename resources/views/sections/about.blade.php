        <h3>Coral reefs contain 25% of the earthâ€™s species but they are are under threat.</h3>
        <p>BREEF created the Sir Nicholas Nuttall Coral Reef Sculpture Garden within the newly-established <a target="_blank" href="http://www.savethebays.bs/wp-content/uploads/West-New-Providence-Marine-Managed-Area-Proposal-FINAL-.pdf">South West New Providence Marine Managed Area</a> to draw attention and inspire specific action to protect our oceans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oil pollution is a major threat to the sculpture garden and adjacent coral reefs. BREEF advocates for the effective clean up. Growing endangered corals at our coral nursery helps restore natural reefs. </p>
